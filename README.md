# Lido DAO Voting UI

### Abstract

Over the past year, there were multiple situations with Aragon voting UI being unavailable or dysfunctional at the times of ongoing DAO votings. It is critical to have a UI-friendly fallback option in the form of Lido's own resilient voting UI app.

### Functionality

The proposed UI consists of one essential page with a limited set of actions available.

The required functionality includes:

- accessing specific voting outside of Aragon voting UI
- getting on-chain details related to specific voting by voting ID (status, voting results, voting start/end date, parsed EVM script)
- connecting wallet (similar to Lido on Ethereum staking widget)
- casting vote (Yes/No)

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js v12+
- Yarn package manager

This project requires an .env file which is distributed via private communication channels. A sample can be found in .env.sample.

## Dockerfile env

- Node.js v16.20.1
- Yarn package manager v1.22.19

## Development

Step 1. Copy the contents of `.env.sample` to `.env.local`

```bash
cp .env.sample .env.local
```

Step 2. Fill out the `.env.local`. You will need to provide RPC provider urls with keys included.

Step 3. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Step 4. Start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Environment variables

Note! Avoid using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables as it hinders our CI pipeline. Please use server-side environment variables and pass them to the client using `getInitialProps` in `_app.js`.

## Automatic versioning
